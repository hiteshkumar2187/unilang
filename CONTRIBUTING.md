         │
2. Comment on the issue to claim it
         │
3. Create a feature branch
         │  git checkout -b feature/my-feature
         │
4. Make your changes
         │
5. Write/update tests
         │
6. Run `make ci` locally
         │
7. Commit with conventional message
         │

## Coding Standards

### Rust (Compiler & Runtime)

- Follow the [Rust API Guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/)
- Use `rustfmt` with the project's `.rustfmt.toml` configuration
- Use `clippy` with no warnings: `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`
- All public APIs must have doc comments (`///`)
- Prefer `Result<T, E>` over panics; compiler must never panic on user code
- Use meaningful error types, not `String` errors
- Test coverage target: >90% for compiler phases

### Documentation

- API documentation follows rustdoc conventions
- User-facing docs use Markdown
- Code examples in docs must compile and pass tests
- Grammar changes must update `LANGUAGE_SPEC.md`

### Testing

```
Unit tests:        Test individual functions and modules
Integration tests: Test compiler phases working together
End-to-end tests:  Test full compilation + execution of .uniL programs
Benchmarks:        Track performance over time
Snapshot tests:    AST/UIR output stability
```

Every PR must include tests for the changes it introduces.

## Commit Guidelines

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
